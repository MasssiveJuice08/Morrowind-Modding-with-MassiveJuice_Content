> [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/) used for Obsidian and Quartz callouts compared against similar-looking icons from Morrowind

While tinkering with ideas for developing a visual style for the [[Morrowind Modding Wiki - Home|Morrowind Modding Wiki]], I've been interested in the potential of using custom Morrowind-themed icons, either directly using Morrowind spell and skill icons (e.g., ![[Note-Callout_MMW.jpg|feather-icon|16x16]]) or creating Morrowind-style versions of the [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/) used for Obsidian and Quartz callouts.

Two possible use-cases for Morrowind-themed icons:

1. Use custom icons for [callouts](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/callouts) in place of Lucide icons.
2. Use these as [emoji prefixes for folders and notes](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/explorer#add-emoji-prefix) 

While the first use-case is straightforward in terms of implementation and is just a question of personal taste, the second use-case is a bit trickier as it presents both notable advantages _and disadvantages_ for accessibility. 

> [!question] Can we tweak Lucide icons to match Morrowind style?
> 
> If placed over blank backgrounds of morrowind icons, we can have universally understood symbols whilst having a Morrowind aesthetic
