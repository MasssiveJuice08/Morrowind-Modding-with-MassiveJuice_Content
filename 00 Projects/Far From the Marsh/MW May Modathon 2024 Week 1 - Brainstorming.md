## Theme - Mysticism and Prophecy

### Brainstorming Plot Ideas
1. **A missing student of mysticism**
	- explore their home/laboratory and pick up the pieces of what happened through fragmentary notes
	- lost while trying to discern patterns from the past - in search of a prophecy?
	- Tell a story in a single room through notes and environmental worldbuilding
2. **The Nerevarine Prophecies**
	- Perhaps an exploration of the fate of one of the [Failed Incarnates](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Failed_Incarnates) such as [[Lore-Peakstar - The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (UESP)|Peakstar]]
		- Though rumors abound regarding Peakstars fate, they fell fighting an Ash Vampire. A quest could follow someone else's attempts to find them

### Quest Name Ideas:
- _A Purrfect Paradox_ - if the mage is a khajiit.
- _Tipping the Scales_ - if the mage is argonian
	- _The Scales of Fate_
	- _Ours is to Ask_

## Implementation
