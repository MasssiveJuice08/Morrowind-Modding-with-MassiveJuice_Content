This is a minimal, vanilla-friendly Morrowind modlist for **OpenMW** I came up with for my friend who wanted to get into Morrowind but was put off by some of its ancient Bethesda jank. Its aim is to provide:

- Modest graphical improvement without going overboard, and keeping performance in mind
- Quality of life improvements and bug fixes 
- Preserved vanilla gameplay and story experience

###  CFG Settings

Locate your `openmw.cfg` file (default location: `Documents\My Games\OpenMW`). Search the text file for "data=", where you will find one entry: the location of your Morrowind install.

Add a newline below this, and paste the contents of [[Modlist for Boss Miriam#^faf158|Data Paths]] below.

Again in your `openmw.cfg` file (default location: `Documents\My Games\OpenMW`), search the text file for "content=". Delete any entries here, then copy and paste the contents of [[Modlist for Boss Miriam#^721290|Plugin Load Order]] below into it.

> [!abstract]- Plugin Load Order

Now locate the `settings.cfg` file (default location: `Documents\My Games\OpenMW`). Insert the text below in [[Modlist for Boss Miriam#^4aeab0|Enabling Groundcover]]. This can be placed as a section anywhere within the settings file - the order of the various settings headings (e.g., `[Groundcover]` `[Camera]`, `[Game]`) does not matter.

> [!abstract]- Enabling Groundcover
> 
> ```
> [Groundcover]
> enabled = true
> density = 1.0
> min chunk size = 1.0
> stomp mode = 2
> stomp intensity = 0
> rendering distance = 6144.0
> ```

Once all three steps are completed, run [DeltaPlugin](https://gitlab.com/bmwinger/delta-plugin) `merge` to generate the `merged.omwaddon` plugin. Then, in `openmw.cfg` add `content=merged.omwaddon` after `content=AttendMe.omwscripts`. Enjoy your vanilla+ Morrowind!

Its CFG Generator and the folder structure recommended by MOMW has also been the basis for the folder structure here.
