## About

the `<kbd> </kbd>` HTML element is used to denote keyboard input (such as "ctrl + alt + del"). Markdown uses backticks to define \`code\`, which in practice is a catch-all for `<kbd>`, `<samp>` (sample computer code output), and `code` HTML elements. By default, the aforementioned HTML elements are styled the same by default, but can be made to be rendered differently. Github renders `<kbd>` elements differently from \`code\`, but Obsidian does not do so by default.

> [!Note] Consider adding custom CSS for \<kbd\> in MMW
> 
> This would improve readability, as currently there is no distinction between code and keyboard input.
