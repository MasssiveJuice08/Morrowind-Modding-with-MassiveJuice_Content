## Publishing Omnivore notes from Obsidian to Digital Garden



### About

I use [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) to save articles and documents while researching a topic. It allows me to tag ('label') them, highlight passages and add notes to my highlights. I'm a pretty forgetful person and with ADHD my brain is working like, what, 512mb of RAM anyway? Citing my sources 

The challenge I have encountered with publishing my  notes is that if a note gets resynced, it overrides the frontmatter. Digital Garden
