[Modding-OpenMW](https://modding-openmw.com/) uses a 'Report a Problem' button on content pages, which links directly to the Gitlab repository's Issues page.

MMW could incorporate the same feature, directing users to the Github repository's Issues page. However, considering that [Giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus) comments have already been integrated, this could be 'double handling'. Giscus may also be better suited, as comments on a page open a Github Discussion focused specifically on the topic of that page.
