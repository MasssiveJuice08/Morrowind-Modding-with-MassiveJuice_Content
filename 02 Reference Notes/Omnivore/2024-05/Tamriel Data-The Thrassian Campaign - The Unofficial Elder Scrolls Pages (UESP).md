[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/https-en-m-uesp-net-wiki-tamriel-data-the-thrassian-campaign-18f6ba7d261)
[Read Original](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Tamriel_Data:The_Thrassian_Campaign)

### Highlights

> On the nature of the Sload, collected from the Notes of Bendu Olo, West King of Anvil and Baron-Admiral of the All Flags Navy, and Dealer of Swift Justice to the Foul Spot of Thras. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-en-m-uesp-net-wiki-tamriel-data-the-thrassian-campaign-18f6ba7d261#ed5e90f6-2d41-4d1c-8994-2d7b11e890fa)  ^ed5e90f6

This TR_Data book is a scathing summary of the Sload

> Perfect memory. They cannot read or write, but they remember everything they see or hear. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-en-m-uesp-net-wiki-tamriel-data-the-thrassian-campaign-18f6ba7d261#e33ea234-9694-4c37-b68d-e3c95c4f5fa6)  ^e33ea234

An interesting idea. Why write ['N'Gasta! Kvata! Kvakis!'](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:N%27Gasta!_Kvata!_Kvakis!)? Perhaps to spread their ideas to others.
