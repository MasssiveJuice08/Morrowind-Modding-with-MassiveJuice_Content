## Highlights

> **Argonian**
> 
> _"Argonians are the savage half-men of the southern marshes. Our peoples used to keep them as slaves, but they are useless. The settled people still keep them as slaves to grub in the soil. They are dirty and wicked, and we should drive them all back into the swamps they came from."_ [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/morrowind-generic-dialogue-a-the-unofficial-elder-scrolls-pages--18f3dca0d47#aa8064ed-f5f9-4563-8b67-25be2654ab95)  ^aa8064ed

Ashlander opinion of Argonians

> "We are the People of the Root, called 'Argonians' by the warmbloods. We go where we will, wet or dry, and the currents of blood magic run swift in our veins. In our native land, we hunt to live, masters of the marshes. Hunted and enslaved by softskinned enemies, we snare and slay them by stealth, spell, and steel." [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/morrowind-generic-dialogue-a-the-unofficial-elder-scrolls-pages--18f3dca0d47#12b1538a-25b2-479f-a716-924f52fa8959)  ^12b1538a

Self-appraisal of Argonians

> "The Argonians of Black Marsh call themselves the 'People of the Root'. They are equally at home on land or in water, and are magically gifted. Persecuted and enslaved by other races, they are cautious and secretive. Little is known of their homeland or native culture, and their alien physiology and customs are not well understood by scholars." [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/morrowind-generic-dialogue-a-the-unofficial-elder-scrolls-pages--18f3dca0d47#55289d16-5606-4533-a4a3-92852551e568)  ^55289d16

Non-Argonian, non-Dunmer appraisal of Argonians; neutral tone.

> "Argonians are cunning, savage beasts incapable of enlightenment. They are blasphemous travesties of nature, with unspeakable foulness in their private and family urges. When guided by a stern hand, they can be trained as passable servants and slaves. By Imperial law, free Argonians have the rights of citizens, but no law can ever make an Argonian human."
