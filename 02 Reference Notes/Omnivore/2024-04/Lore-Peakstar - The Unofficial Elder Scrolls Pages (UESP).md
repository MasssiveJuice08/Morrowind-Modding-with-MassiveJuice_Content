### Highlights

> The [Tribunal Temple](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tribunal%5FTemple "Lore:Tribunal Temple") searched for her unsuccessfully for many years, and finally, shortly before the fulfillment of the [Nerevarine Prophecies](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nerevarine%5FProphecies "Lore:Nerevarine Prophecies") around [3E 427](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Third%5FEra#3E%5F427 "Lore:Third Era"), they announced she was dead.[\[3\]](#cite%5Fnote-MWSharn-3) Ashlanders were under the belief that she had been found and captured at some point.[\[1\]](#cite%5Fnote-MWAshlanders-1) Rumors persisted that she was still alive, as the Temple could not produce a body.[\[3\]](#cite%5Fnote-MWSharn-3) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/lore-peakstar-the-unofficial-elder-scrolls-pages-uesp-18f2e0a6910#645aa981-c5a5-4d6f-a19d-b829c9036e10)  ^645aa981

Peakstar, the failed Incarnate - Dead or alive? Her spirit is in the Cavern of the Incarnate, so this is likely confirmation of her death (to the Nerevarine, at least). Perhaps you can find her body in temple custody.
