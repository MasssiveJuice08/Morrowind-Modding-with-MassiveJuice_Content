## SMOOTH Image Zoom on Hover Effects with CSS

### Highlights

> We need a container element which will be hovered and then the image inside it should animate accordingly, i.e. zoom-in or zoom-out as per the need.
> 
> Note that the image should zoom on hover inside the container element and do not come or flow outside of it when it gets zoomed.
> 
> So, the basic idea is to limit the container element with the CSS **overflow** property.
> 
> The zooming and animation parts will be handled with the CSS3 **transform** and **transition** properties respectively. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-w-3-bits-com-css-image-hover-zoom-18f1a310388#a153adb4-d0dc-4350-8b02-08bff4dd091c)  ^a153adb4

How to create on-hover image zoom container

> /* [1] The container */
> .img-hover-zoom {
>   height: 300px; /* [1.1] Set it as per your need */
>   overflow: hidden; /* [1.2] Hide the overflowing of child elements */
> }
> 
> /* [2] Transition property for smooth transformation of images */
> .img-hover-zoom img {
