### Highlights

> Technical writing is writing about a particular subject requiring direction, instruction, explanation or clarification. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-medium-com-brian-639-technical-writing-101-the-ultimate-gu-1900fdde322#85b78c77-0b09-4736-9e1f-0399de2bcc34)  ^85b78c77

> The 7 C’s of professional communication, when used, will produce writing that is:
> 
> • **Clear:** The reader can immediately understand the goal of a document when it is written clearly. Clear writing also fits vocabulary to the audience, minimizing unneeded jargon and technical terminology while yet being exact
> 
> • **Coherent:** The reader will be able to follow your ideas and your line of reasoning if your writing is coherent. One concept should logically lead to the next.
> 
> • **Concise:** Make use of the fewest words necessary to express the most thought while keeping the writing clear. Refrain from adding extra space, being imprecise, and using unnecessary repetition and redundancy.
> 
> • **Concrete:** Describe your thoughts in detail and utilize precise language to help your audience see what you are trying to convey.
> 
> • **Correct:** Use standard English language and punctuation. Give accurate information and use the proper format and document type for your writing.
> 
> • **Complete:** Provide all the necessary details and respond to all pertinent queries. Your document is more likely to be complete if you are more precise and concrete.
> 
> • **Courteous:** Use a reader-friendly, simple-to-read document. Use considerate language, and an audience-appropriate approach and avoid potentially objectionable vocabulary, usage and tone.

> ## Organizing Information Logically and Coherently
> 
> Studies have shown that people read technical documents most frequently to find quick solutions. As a result, the structure of technical content is essential for readers to swiftly and easily find what they need.
> 
> You can use these guidelines to create well-organized technical documentation:
> 
> 1. Categorize the information into distinct subjects according to the types of content so that users will know what to expect.
> 2. Tasks are typically executed in a specific order, therefore you should also organize them by order of use.
> 3. Separate contextual information from other kinds of information.
> 4. Prioritize primary ideas and subordinate ideas. For instance, you can use repetition or reinforcement to maintain the reader’s attention on the main idea.
